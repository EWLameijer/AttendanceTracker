# 009_file_structure_of_project

## Context

Wubbo and I had some discussions about the best file structure. There wasn't a lot of structure early on, as pages were simply made and left in place when they worked.
Wubbo has since restructured the files a bit to match a video he found on the matter.
He's of the opinion that we're a "small project" as discussed in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhSXNY8sy_0
I agree, it seems most suitable.

## Decision

We'll imitate the "small project" file structure as described in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhSXNY8sy_0

## Status [Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded]

Accepted

## Consequences

Some more minor refactoring might be needed to more closely imitate the "small project" file structure.
