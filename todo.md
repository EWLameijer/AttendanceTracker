1) Scenarios and personas would be helpful
2) Wireframes would help
3) Coding conventions may be useful, including hor/vert slicing, KISS/YAGNI etc.
4) plugins IntelliJ
5) plugins VS Code
6) IntelliJ: actions on save & other settings
7) ADR: notes on Lombok?
8) Ubiquitous Language?
9) Create Scrumboard (Git? Trello?)
10) Possibly ERDs and/or DDD-like class diagrams
11) Create/add simple frontend

Programmatically:

- frontend showing students
- day can be today (or hardcoded to 2023-11-27)
- for now: List of student name and status. Fancy graphics for later

// Will likely need attendanceReports
(Wubbo reported presence on date/time)
But skip that for now.
