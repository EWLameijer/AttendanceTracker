Programmatically:
Update front-end to use coach-view and teacher-view instead!

- fundamentally: basic is view:
    - coach-view/juan/dates/... later remove name for login
    - teacher-view/wubbo/dates/...
    - group-admin-view/chantal/groups/...
    - schedule-admin-view/chantal/groups/...
- window to edit groups
    - add / remove groups
    - add/remove students from group
- update students to not only have group, but also to-from dates
- window to add dates per group
    - add date and teacher

- Fancy graphics for showing student status
